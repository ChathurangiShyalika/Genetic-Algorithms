# Genetic-Algorithms



The objective of the demo is to maximize the equation :  y = w1x1+w2x2+w3x3+w4x4+w5x5

    where (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5)=(8,-2,1.5,-3,-14)
    
    What are the best values for the 5 weights w1 to w5?
    
    The solution has been obtained using genetic algorithm for the best possible values after a number of generations.u
